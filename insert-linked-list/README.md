#Code Fellows JS-401
##Linked Lists

This assignment consisted of taking function code that creates a linked list and adding a method called deleteListItem to a module called linked-list.js which allows you to delete a list item from an existing linked list at any location. If an error occurs the callback will stop.

## Getting Started
- Fork this repository: https://github.com/jlhiskey/05-linked-lists-FUNdamentals

- The local repository should now contain a folder structure that matches the one shown below.
    - lib/ : contains module definitions
    - data/ : contains the text files used by the program
    - --test__/ : contains unit tests
 - Now in your terminal you will need to install dependencies using
