# Fizz-Buzz

 - You are given a binary-tree. 
 ## Function
 - When you run the tree though the function fizzBomb is will check the values of each node of the tree. 
 ### Dividable by 3
 - If the original value can be divided by 3 and the result is a whole number than the fizzBomb will change that nodes value to 'fizz'.
 ### Dividable by 5
 - If the original value can be divided by 5 and the result is a whole number than the fizzBomb will change that nodes value to 'buzz'.
 ### Dividable by 3 and 5
 - If the original value can be divided by 3 and 5 and the result of either operation is a whole number than the fizzBomb will change that nodes value to 'fizzbuzz'.
